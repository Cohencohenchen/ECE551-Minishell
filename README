To run myShell, make and ./myShell.

I write three classes, myShell, MyVar and Command, the last two serve as member of the first one.

MyVar class stores variables and path, as well as mathod to modify them.

Command class stores command from input, as well as how to inteprete them.

I've written testcases for you in TestCases.txt.

There are some test programs as well, use them as the TestCases.txt says and the instruction inside them.
